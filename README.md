# sopel-cookiecutter
Template for Sopel modules. To use:

```sh
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:sopel-irc/sopel-cookiecutter
```

You can then release the module on PyPI in the normal Python way.

Obviously, you can modify anything that the template builds, so don't feel
constrained to this one way of doing things. Please do submit PRs to this repo
if you think the template can be improved.
